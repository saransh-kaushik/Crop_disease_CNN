## Overview

Plant diseases significantly impact crop yield and food security. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories using the **New Plant Diseases Dataset** from Kaggle. The CNN model is trained to identify various diseases based on images of plant leaves.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **New Plant Diseases Dataset** available on Kaggle:  
[New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

The dataset includes images of healthy and diseased plant leaves across various plant species, categorized into multiple classes.

## Installation
